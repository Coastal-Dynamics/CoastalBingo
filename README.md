# Coastal Geomorphology Bingo!

Who among us hasn't gazed out an airplane window at a majestic ebb-tidal delta and thought, "Oh man, I would totally win Coastal Geomorphology Bingo right now!"? Whether you're travelling by plane, train, or boat, don't forget to pack your Coastal Geomorphology Bingo Card! 

We started playing bingo last year in our Coastal Systems class to get the students pumped up about geomorphology and paying attention, and it worked surprisingly well. The random bingo card generation code is available here on Github as part of our push to develop more Open Education Resources for coastal science and engineering.
